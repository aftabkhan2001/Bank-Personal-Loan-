# EVALUATION METRICS 
## ROC AUC CURVES WITH HYPERPARAMETER TUNING 

## Hyperparameter Tuning Boosts Model Performance
Post-tuning, ROC scores shine brighter:
### Logistic Regression: +0.95%
### Naive Bayes: +0.93%
### Support Vector Machine: +0.97%
Top Performer: Support Vector Machine
With the highest post-tuning ROC score, the Support Vector Machine steals the spotlight. Optimal choice for superior model performance compared to Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Decision madeâ€”Support Vector Machine leads the pack! ðŸš€

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the analysis reveals that the dataset contains a highly imbalanced target variable, with a majority of customers (4520) not taking personal loans (0) and a smaller number (480) taking loans (1).
Further exploration indicates that customers with educational backgrounds in Graduation and Professional categories are more likely to take personal loans compared to those with an Undergraduate education.
Family size also plays a role, with customers from families with 3 or 4 members showing a higher tendency to take personal loans.
The absence of a securities account seems to be associated with a higher likelihood of taking a personal loan, while having a Certificate of Deposit (CDAccount) is positively correlated with personal loan uptake.
Additionally, customers using online banking services are more inclined to have personal loans.
There is a negative trend where individuals with credit cards are less likely to take out personal loans.
Addressing the imbalanced target variable, the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method has been employed along with standard scaling for numeric features (age, CCavg, mortgage, income).
Outliers are present but are not considered as error points.
Among the tested algorithms after the Hyperparammeter Tuning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine), SVM outperforms others across multiple metrics, including accuracy (0.95%), precision (0.74%), recall (0.84%), F1 score (0.79%) & Roc Auc Score (0.97%).
This suggests that SVM is the most suitable model for predicting personal loan uptake in this dataset
